Lemonade Change Problem from https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/

/*
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  

You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

Example:
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
