Palindrome Number from https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

/*
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
Input: 121
Output: true
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
